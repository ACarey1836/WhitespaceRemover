Welcome to the Extra Whitespace Eliminator 2!

This program is designed to remove extra whitespace characters
from a .txt file and output the converted file in the same
folder.

To use, select the file you want to convert, then press
the "Remove whitespace" button.

That is about it. Nothing fancy. If things break or you
run into bugs, my email is carey.andrew1836@gmail.com.

If you're interested in the source code, you can find it on
here: https://github.com/ACarey1836/WhitespaceRemover

Good luck and have fun!
